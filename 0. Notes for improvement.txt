How to incorporate different fields into the steps. Do we just dump into it or add as a new step?


what features do we apply cross validation on?

the number of trees in the forest (n_estimators) - more the better.
the number of features to consider at each split. By default: square root of total number of features (max_features).
the maximum depth of a tree i.e. number of nodes (max_depth).
the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node / bottom of a tree (min_samples_leaf).

Also whats the stopping point in optimising the prediction model?
