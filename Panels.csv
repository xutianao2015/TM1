491,"Technical Services Provider Panel for the Critical Infrastructure Program for Modelling and Analysis (CIPMA) CIPMA is a key component of the Australian Government's efforts to enhance critical infrastructure resilience and is a major national security initiative. CIPMA seeks to examine the relationships, dependencies and interdependencies between critical infrastructure systems, and understand how a failure in one sector can greatly affect the operation of critical infrastructure and delivery of essential services in other sectors. The CIPMA capability includes economic modelling, spatial analysis, Geographic Information System (GIS), systems analysis, demographic analysis and simulation. Critical Infrastructure comprises those physical facilities, supply chains, information technologies and communication networks, which if destroyed, degraded or rendered unavailable for an extended period, would significantly impact on the social or economic wellbeing of the nation, or affect Australia's ability to conduct national defence and ensure national security. CIPMA is linked closely to the Australian Government's Critical Infrastructure Resilience Strategy that seeks to enhance the resilience of our critical infrastructure to all hazards (which includes both natural and human induced disasters). This is an open panel. New organisations are welcome to apply to join the panel at any time up to 30 June 2015 and any extension of the panel exercised by AGD. New applicants will be required to satisfy the same requirements as current members of the panel.

 The NSW Government ICT Services Scheme is the new model for delivering ICT services to NSW Government. These new arrangements will ensure NSW government agencies can find and procure the goods and services that best meet their needs, and makes it easier for industry to do business with government.
The Scheme arose from extensive consultation about how government and industry can make the most of procurement opportunities.
The Scheme features include:
- A new straightforward online application for suppliers removes lengthy and expensive tender processes.
- An “always open” policy, so new suppliers can register for inclusion on the Scheme at any time, giving agencies continual access to new suppliers and emerging technologies.
- Streamlined ICT service categories aligned to the ICT Strategy, enabling suppliers to align their offerings and maximise opportunities to provide services to government.
- Introduction of two supplier lists: The Registered Supplier List for low risk contracts valued up to $150,000; and the Advanced Registered Supplier List for high risk contracts or contracts valued over $150,000. Suppliers can apply for inclusion on one or both of these lists, depending on their capacity and capability.
- A new, simple short-form contract for the low risk low value category of work provides opportunities for small to medium businesses. It includes simplified terms and lower insurance requirements, reducing the cost of doing business with government.

DPC and Microsoft agreed to extend the term of this EA to 31 March 2020. As part of the extension, a substantial number of terms and conditions were renegotiated and the revised EA was implemented via a Deed as Variation 3 to the contract. 
The EA is for the provision of Microsoft products and services. The EA terms, licensing rules, scope of supply and discount arrangements are captured in this revised strategic contractual arrangement.
